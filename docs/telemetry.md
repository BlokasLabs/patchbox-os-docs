# Telemetry

Patchbox OS comes with Pisound software pre-installed, which includes the `blokas-telemetry` package. When enabled, the software occasionally gathers fully anonymous usage data points - active sessions count, Patchbox OS module versions, the percentage of sessions with Pisound HAT attached, and the Raspberry Pi model in use. These data points help us prioritize and make more informed decisions on future Patchbox OS updates. To facilitate privacy and secure transfer of the telemetry data to Blokas servers, it is anonymized, encrypted, and sent over a secure channel. In accordance with GDPR guidelines on anonymous usage data collection, `blokas-telemetry` package comes enabled by default.
